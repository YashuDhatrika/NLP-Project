# Implementation of Text to SQL for NLIDB systems using NLP and Deep Learning:
We aim to make information easily available to non technical users. One of the major sources
of information is Databases. Users of any background can analyze large amounts of data
if they are able to use natural language processing to query databases.Hence we need a
system that is able to yield SQL queries automatically by simply interpreting the user questions
given to it. We use various end to end deep learning models and probability model such as
conditional random field to achieve this.
